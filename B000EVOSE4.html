<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:black"> Allow me to weave a tale for you. A tale of heartache, lose, embarrassment, shame and of course, public expulsion of the slippery black liquid that must surely be the blood of Satan. My daughter is five. She is the light of my life and the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. She loves ballet. She falls asleep during every performance we take her to but she loves it all the same. So when it came to that special time of year for her winter ballet concert, I was the proudest man in the whole theater.As is customary at venues such as these, there was a lovely little bake sale set up in the entryway which housed all manner of decadent confectionaries and baked treats that both stirred my hunger and saddened it all the same. You see I am not a small man and a recent visit to the doctors had proven distressing. Healthier steps had to be taken to ensure that one day I would have the tearful honor of giving my daughter away at her wedding, so of course I took those steps seriously. Yet with my doctors advice still ringing in my ears, I could not help but sneak over to the table while my wifeâ€™s back was turned to peruse the assortment. Then, through the haze of custard-filled cupcakes, mouthwatering brownies and tutu shaped sugar cookies, I saw them. A gleaming light at the end of a sweets filled tunnel; my salvation in the sea of sugar. If only I knewâ€¦ If only I could have known.Lovingly wrapped in individual sized, hand-made plastic baggies and tied with delicate siphon ribbon, lay my salvation atop the mountains of delectable morsels. Gummy bears are not generally my thing, but after two weeks of strict dieting and bearing the word â€?Sugar-freeâ€? emblazoned across the front, they might as well have been ambrosia from the Gods themselves. The adorable little girl behind the plastic folding table leaped up at my approach. She was younger than my daughter and wore the bright pink outfit of a ballerina with pride. She tugged on her mothers arm and pointed to me with a huge smile wrapping from ear to ear. The mother welcomed me and asked what Iâ€™d like. I could hardly contain myself as I exclaimed â€?three packages of gummy bears please!â€? In my exuberance I had drawn a little too much attention, in the form of my wife.She came over like a whisper in a field and asked what I was getting. In my glee I turned around with three of the packages tucked neatly into my arms wearing a smile to match my new friends. My loving wife frowned and tried to pull a package from my grasp but found them to be cemented in place. She chuckled at me and gave me the look that made me marry her. â€?You can have one bagâ€¦ now. Then rest youâ€™ll have to save for later.â€? I kissed her and we readied ourselves for the performance of our daughterâ€™s career. Little did I know, that she had once again saved my life.I merrily snacked on the little multi-colored gems of pure pleasure as the concert got underway. The girls where charming and the scene was festive. It was a perfect nightâ€¦ right up until the first rumble that alerted me to the possibility of danger. It started off quiet and subtle much like the performance, but soon it too grew to a crescendo. As I shifted my weight in the hard plastic seats, I knew I was in trouble the moment I touched my brow. Beads of warning sweat had started to form, though soon the trickle would give way to a deluge. I loosened my special Christmas tie and dabbed at my face with my sleeve in an effort to remain for the most important night of my daughters young life. My wife noticed my anguish and leaded over to ask me what was wrong. I tried to tell herâ€¦ I really did, but the pain had become more then I could bear as a painful tide crashed upon my anus. Try as I might, the bears were fighting back, seemingly set on draining my body, in itâ€™s entirety, of life giving liquid.It was no good. I would have to try to make it to the restroom. I tried to excuse myself but the effort of even shifting my shaking legs told my body it was too late. If I moved it would be the end of me and all that I held dear. I sat in silent anguish, biting my lip to try and focus my mind on anything other than the pulsating waves of torment aching to breech the confines of my intestines. The cheery holiday music sounded in stark juxtaposition to the symphony of horrors growing inside of me.Then it happened. I thought it was nothing. It was just to relieve some of the pressure I told myself. What started as an attempt to allow only gas to leave quickly turned into a levy shattering entirely. I gripped my wifeâ€™s hand and looked with tearful eyes into hers, begging for forgiveness as the expulsion sloshed like Niagara falls onto the theater floor. I sobbed silently as the shame overtook me and there was nothing else to do but expel the demon from my core. â€?Oh my God!â€? One woman cried as she was swept away in the torrent. She was never seen again. I begged all that was holy, any Gods that were listening, to take pity on my wretched soul and deliver me from this hell. Yet none answered. There was only the flow. It gushed out of me despite the screams of the others in my row and those around them. I couldnâ€™t have stopped it if I tried, but God help meâ€¦ I didnâ€™t. I couldnâ€™t. The comingling of relief, searing pain and shame sounded in my cries for mercy.I must have blacked out from the pain. Because when I came to I was laying on my back in my own filth with two paramedics standing over me. They were obviously trying to suppress  their gagging as they worked on me. I couldnâ€™t blame them. The stench was overwhelming; thick and oppressive like a sickly sweet blanket on a warm summers eve. As they carted me out I heard one of them screaming to a stage hand for a bucketâ€¦ apparently I wasnâ€™t done just yet. I begged them for my family but they simply screamed. The next two days were a blur of IVâ€™s, doctors and what I think was an African Medicine man, though I was on some heavy duty painkillers.When I was finally released I was mad. The shame was more than my fragile male ego could handle and I wanted justice. Surely that mother had laced the gummies with some kind of laxative, like a sick twisted joke but after confronting the woman she told me that she had done nothing to the bears at all. Then she showed me the original package. A 5 pound bag of Haribo Sugerfree Gummy bearsâ€¦ and right there on the label was a warning. It was one she had taken a little too lightly. I researched further and found the very same treats here. I poured over the reviews, each one worse than the last until finally I could come to only one conclusion. The devil himself must laugh at we mortal for we are his playthings.Also they were a little too chewy.</span></p><p><strong>File link:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UZHYS78G9BJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UZHYS78G9BJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</a> </p><p><strong>Sentiment result:</strong> 2 , <strong>Entities:</strong>  , <strong>Rating:</strong>3 , <strong>Sarcastic:</strong> false </p><br><hr><br>

<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:black"> A classic candy with 5 mild flavors & colors. Firmer than other bears but you're getting more product than water unlike the Albanese bears that list list H20 as the second most used ingredient!! I would swear that the big bags taste milder than the tiny store bought bags but it is most likely me and my changing taste buds.For the current price offered these are fair and competitively priced. May not be BuRsTiNg with flavor but flavor nonetheless. The overall smell can be intoxicating. Of the three top brands here, these look the least like bears.I would recommend enjoying these with a clean palate - especially of other sweets.  (and brush your teeth afterwords : )An affordable filler for a Mixed Gummy Animal Salad!</span></p><p><strong>File link:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BYJDZUHVQSTH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BYJDZUHVQSTH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</a> </p><p><strong>Sentiment result:</strong> 2 , <strong>Entities:</strong>  , <strong>Rating:</strong>4 , <strong>Sarcastic:</strong> false </p><br><hr><br>

<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:black"> This is a cautionary tale and - unlike most of the other reviews on this product - this is a true story and its authenticity can be qualified by a small news item that appeared in the Toronto Star's local news section during the month of April in 2013, much to my chagrin.I would consider myself a prudent man. Not given to bouts of outspokenness or craving attention, and certainly not one to rock the boat. On any given day I can be found reading a crime novel on a park bench in the middle of the city, soaking in the opulence of nature while nibbling on my tuna fish sandwiches and fending off the voracious gulls and squirrels that threaten to spoil my repose. This is me. Law-abiding and introspective. Which is why it came as a shock to me to find myself incarcerated because of the Devil's Confectionery, Satan's Sweetmeat, Lucifer's Lozenges - the horror that is known as 'Haribo Sugar Free Gummy Bears".I'll set the scene: It was late winter / early spring in Toronto and the city had just been digging itself out from a late season snow-storm. I was heading to Pearson International Airport for a redeye flight to Amsterdam in order to give the Dutch arm of our company some training on the new software that had been installed (I'm deliberately being vague to prevent my place of work from being linked in any way to the incident that occurred). I had just finished packing, checked the time and found I was running late, my flight was at 7:10 PM and it was now almost 5:00 PM. Cursing softly, I ran out to the car and threw my bags in the trunk, hitting the gas a little harder than usual in my haste to make it to the Long Term Parking Lot as soon as possible. Luckily traffic was light on the 401 and I made it to the airport in record time, but knew that my chances of making the flight were still at risk if I didn't use my time wisely.I hadn't eaten since lunch, and I was feeling a bit hungry, my stomach rumbling loudly in protestation, which caused me to look around at the other travellers rushing past me in the busy terminal, mortified that my bodily noises might be heard by others. I briskly checked my watch and decided that I had enough time to grab a quick snack before going through the baggage check and security, and would get something more substantial once I was checked through security. I spotted a vending machine nestled in a relatively low-traffic corner of the terminal and rushed over, already pulling out my credit-card and mentally assessing what I had a craving for so as to save time interacting with the machine. My eyes scanned the colourful array of confection quickly, coming to rest on a tantalizing, rainbow-coloured bag of gummy bears with the simple white and red logo "Haribo" emblazoned across the bag in what appeared to be a slightly tweaked Helvetica Rounded font.Now I'd to pause here in the story for a moment to underscore the importance of making proper choices. I was hungry. When you're hungry, you should eat FOOD. FOOD is defined as "a nutritious substance that people consume to maintain life", this is what food is. These days, the definition of the word 'food' has been bastardized and the meaning has been broadened to include veritably any material that can be digested, or rather, chewed and swallowed without causing death or severe illness. "Haribo Sugar Free Gummy Bears" are NOT food. They aren't even from this planet. I imagine their origins being conceived in a boardroom in hell by a top team of Creative Pain Administers, with senior level Demons rubbing their hands together in ghoulish delight as Hell's Chief Chemist slowly lifts the veil on their new creation.The point here being, I made a very, very, very poor choice. I pushed the button and the vending machine ejected the brightly coloured bag into my awaiting hands. I had always liked gummy bears - they were bright but rather innocuous, they weren't overly sweet so as to become cloying and - of course - each candy came in the visage of a rather happy, docile bear reminiscent of the picture one's mind's eye holds of all anthropomorphic bears from Yogi to Winnie.The way I figured it, I was taking a bit of a holiday from life, so I could relax my fastidiously regimented daily schedule a little to allow for some frivolity. After all, I was going to be in Amsterdam come morning with 16 hours to kill before I had to be training the Dutch employees, maybe I would take a trip down to one of the Coffee Shops in the Red-Light District and really let my hair down! No, I wouldn't do that. I would see that area of the city from the bus as I went to the hotel where I would eat at the hotel restaurant and drink sparkling water. So I'd better enjoy the gummy bears, my one extravagance to commemorate my break from routine.I joined the queue in the KLM line, which was mercifully short, most likely because all of the passengers for my flight had already been checked through as the flight was scheduled to depart in an hour. I checked my watch again, frowned, and absent-mindedly opened the bag of "Haribo Sugar Free Gummy Bears" and began to munch on them as the line slowly advanced. To be fair, they tasted fine - just like every other manufacturer's brand of the colourful candy, and they were sugar-free to boot. This is what made the whole incident that followed so baffling - if they had tasted 'off' or 'different' I most likely wouldn't have continued to shovel them into my mouth absent-mindedly while daydreaming about what I would order to eat from room-service in my hotel in Amsterdam.As I gave the attendant my e-ticket and she weighed my bags, the first of the pains began in my stomach. I thought nothing of it at first, chalking it up to the fact that I needed something more substantial than gummy worms to tackle my hunger, but over the course of the next five-minutes the shooting pain began to come in more rapid succession. At this point, I had my boarding pass printed and rubbing my stomach a little, I proceeded to security. I briefly entertained the thought of trying to find a restroom before going through security, but at that point my discomfort was manageable and I didn't think it was get any worse, certainly not within the amount of time it would take to clear security.I joined the line and started fishing for my passport to present to the agent checking tickets, I felt a thin sheen of sweat break out on my forehead and underarms, and my features flushed for a moment as a wave of heat washed over me. I didn't pay it much heed as going through security always caused me great anxiety and I chalked it up to pre-flight jitters. It was only as I stood face to face with the agent and handed her my passport and ticket that I had a glimpse of the agony that was about to begin. It felt like time rippled for a moment, as if my consciousness buckled so intense was the pain that fired through my bowels. I grimaced spastically and emitted a low moan, and felt myself take an involuntary step sideways. Stars shot though my head briefly and my vision blurred and then snapped back into focus. The agent was staring at me with slight consternation and asked me if I was alright. I pulled myself together, stood up straight and declared that I was fine, mortified that I had had a lapse of decorum not only in public but at the security clearance in an airport!As I fumbled off my belt to go through the metal detector, the pain in my stomach increased and I practically had to sit on the floor to take my shoes off, terrified of what would happen if I bent at the middle to do it. It was becoming increasingly more evident to me that this wasn't just a stomach ache. No, this was something much worse. As a child I had had a bout of diarrhea after a trip to Mexico with my family, I remember the feeling of nausea that swept through me before my child self had surrendered to the gas pains and parked myself on the toilet for an hour, s***ting until I felt like I didn't have any bones left. And that was how I was feeling now, with several key differences - the pain was worse, the sense of an impending bowel movement was so formidable it gave me temporary amnesia, and it took all of my will-power, all of it, to clench my butt cheeks together to prevent my sphincter from exploding.A sudden shock of pain racked my body, and I half wondered if I was going to give birth to a Tasmanian Devil. The crazy, fever-induced image of said cartoon animal chasing Bugs Bunny through the splashy, volcanic s***-kettle that was my stomach, caused me to illicit a short, maniacal bark of laughter as I approached the Metal detector, a wild, distant look in my eyes, sweat now beginning to poor off of my like a long-distance runner in Kenya. The security agent on the other side of the detector shot a quick glance over to her co-worker who narrowed his eyes and made a subtle movement towards his holster. My breathing became uneven as I entered the metal detector and I realized with alarm that I had taken off my socks without even registering it, and one of my shirt tails was untucked at the front. I held my breath, my eyes bulging dangerously from my head as the machine scanned me. As I shakily moved forward towards the agent for a pat down, my stomach began to illicit sounds that can only be described as otherworldly. It started off a sort-off bubbling sound heard from afar and grew in pitch and intensity at an alarming rate. My jaw dropped in shock as what I can only describe as the sound of an agonized wailing alley-cat in heat with a persistent Doppler effect added to it's voice emitted from some nether-region of my intestines. The officer's eyes widened in alarm, and she kept her eyes glued to my stomach as she thoroughly patted me down. As she reached my shins, I felt my innards suddenly expand, and plummet towards my rectum. With cat-like reflexes I squeezed my sphincter shut with what seemed like nano-seconds to spare, and I knew, I KNEW that if I didn't get the bathroom immediately I would s*** myself.With a Herculean effort and all of the strength that I could muster, I forced my buttcheeks together knowing that one false move would open the floodgates. I began to walk like a duck, trying to remain as inconspicuous as possible, not even caring now what other people were seeing in front of them - a disheveled, barefoot 40-year-old business man, red-faced and bulgy-eyed, sweating profusely, shaking slightly and walking without bending his knees. With single-minded intensity I grabbed my carry-on, shoes and socks from out of the plastic tub that had passed the x-ray inspection, and without putting anything back on, I turned on my heels with the intention of finding the nearest restroom and slowly dying there one squirt at a time.But that's not what happened.I turned to go and found myself staring at three armed agents who stopped me and asked if I would follow them. "Why, what's the matter?" I stammered, wincing slightly as the act of speech seemed to strain the tenuous and extremely fragile truce I had negotiated between my bowels and the tempest that raged within. "I have to go the bathroom, RIGHT NOW" I pleaded. "Just follow us please", they said, leaving no room for argument. The other travellers clearing the security check stared with curiosity and revulsion at the spectacle unfolding before them, whispering amongst themselves and hurrying to pack up their belongings and get as far away from me as possible, no doubt assuming that the airport had nabbed some sort of domestic terrorist. If I hadn't been feverishly trying to hold back the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, I likely would have died of shame.With each step I took towards the room that they ushered me into, I felt that my legs would give way. I marvelled at how strong the human will could be. Marvelled at what was essentially patching a hole in the Hoover Dam with bubblegum could actually be sustained indefinitely. Maybe I would make it through this ordeal after all. The room they brought me into was an examination room. I had pretty much stopped registering details of my environment as my consciousness closed off all but the absolutely necessary functions - breathing, ability to walk - but I snapped back to reality when I heard the snap of rubber. The slow dawning of realization poked through my agony and stoic resolve as I turned to face an agent dawning rubber gloves."Sir, we are going to perform a cavity search on you", a young fresh-faced agent stated in a firm but emotionless voice. His short-cropped, blond hair was immaculate and for a crazy moment I wondered if he was an actor and this was all some sort of elaborate practical joke done to amuse bored kids watching Youtube. He must have taken my tortured silence for resistance because he looked at me sharply and said "Lower your pants and underwear please, and face the desk". Panic started to grip me in it's icy grasp and the sudden adrenaline threatened to destroy my sphincters bulwarks and rend my anus in two. I inhaled sharply and with a pained gasp I doubled up my efforts to clench my cheeks together. "Sir, please", I begged deferring to this kid in an act of desperation, "I have to go to the bathroom. You can follow me into the stall if you need to but I had some bad "Haribo Sugar Free Gummy Bears" and now I feel like'", but they had stopped listening and smirked at each other, two of the other agents - a tall, dark-haired female and a shorter, balding fat man - looked away from me and I could see them shaking a little as they stifled their laughs. "Sir, face the wall, put your hands on the desk and spread your cheeks" the young agent stated, a lop-sided grin on his face. "But'", I began to protest, and then a fresh shock of pain forced me to stop and lean on the table for support as an ungodly howling rose from my stomach, something between the dying moans of a Wholly Mammoth, and the sound of bubble-wrap popping underwater. I exhaled shakily and my focus began to narrow, as I rallied for the final battle. Shaking uncontrollably and sweat literally raining down onto the tabletop in from of me, I turned to face the wall and heard a meek childlike voice, pleading from somewhere in the room. "Please", it said, and then again, "Please". From somewhere within me my mind recognized that this sound had issued from me, although my consciousness had now begun to separate from my body and I held my breath and prayed to God for strength."He probably has some heroin or something up there that opened up", the female guard said as a part of me that hadn't escaped into the ether yet acknowledged that she was behind me to my left, "probably high as a kite, LOOK at him", she said. The shorter guard agreed with a snort, off to my right."Spread your cheeks" the young agent said, his voice directly behind me and lower than the other two, "and bend over"."Pleasegodpleasegodpleasegodpleasegod", I whispered in a desperate, maniacal mantra, not even aware of my surroundings anymore. I felt like I was lost in an opium fog with half-snatched images and sounds filtering through to create a nonsensical version of reality. Another volley of pain tore through me and I involuntarily leaned forward over the desk, my focus completely narrowed now to a spot on the wall two feet in front of me, a curious imperfection in the what seemed to be white-washed stone wall. It was a dark blotch about five millimetres long and shaped like a smiling bear, a yellow dancing bear. No, a green bear. No, red. It was all the colours of the rainbow. My god, it was beautiful.It just took something as simple as a slight breeze to trigger Armegeddon. That's all. No trumpets, no fanfare, no fire raining from the heavens, no dogs and cats living together in harmony, no finger on the button, no prophet to predict it, no nothing. As I stared at the rainbow bear smiling and dancing in front of me, my mouth agape, drooling, eyes glazed and blood-shot, face coated with a sheen of sweat, I heard the softest sound, an exhalation from the young agent behind me, and then at the same instant the warm air of his breath feather across my butt cheeks. For just a moment, maybe less, maybe a split second, even a nanosecond, I felt the presence of God there with me in that room as neurons began to misfire at a blinding rate, nerve ending bristled and muscles twitched reflexively. I stood on the brink with one foot hovering over the edge, and then without taking a step, I found myself plummeting.With a sound like an extra large plastic ketchup bottle being run over by a Mac truck, my sphincter released. The pressure of the blast pushed me hard into the desk and the legs of the desk screeched as they scraped across the floor. My body remained rigid for a moment and I experienced a relief that can only be described as orgasmic in it's purity. My eyes rolled back in my head and my tongue lolled out of my head like a half-retarded dog and I emitted a low, sustained groan that grew in pitch as the filthy torrent pushed its way out of my body. Tremors wracked my body and I must have looked like a fish out of water with an endless stream of s*** firing out of its ass. Other sounds and sensations started to filter in now as my consciousness began to materialize once more. The muffled scream of a dungeon filled with prisoners near death radiated from my stomach, the rushing sound of litres of liquid trying to escape through an aperture too small to accommodate it all at the same time, the omnipresent sound of chunky liquid spattering against a hard surface with great force, the high-pitched screaming of a woman's voice calling out to God, another voice sobbing uncontrollably imploring to "make it stop!!!" and my own ecstatic, monotone wail.When my ordeal had eventually run its course, I was left panting for breath and wobbly legged, half-crying, half-laughing with relief, barely lucid and feeling as if I had birthed an elephant. My colon felt like someone had poured chile sauce all over it and then sent in a colony of fire ants to eat it. Through my sobs I heard the sound of dripping, like when the sprinklers are eventually turned off after an office fire, or after a thunderstorm when the willow that overhangs a pond continues to rain down long after the sky has stopped. From behind me, the sobbing continued and I heard someone trying to speak into a walkie-talkie but nonsensical words were all that the man could speak, which sounded like the ravings of a lunatic.With great relief, I slowly pulled myself off the table, legs trembling, my stomach eliciting one last sound, a loud prolonged gas bubbling that eerily resembled a pig orgasm. I slowly turned my head to survey the devastation and in that instant, if I had had a pencil or some other sharp object, I probably would have gouged my eyes out in revulsion. And the smell. The smell was enough to drive a man insane. It was the stench of rotting potatoes mixed with sulphur and ammonia, cooked in a broth of chicken feces and left to age for two weeks in a yeasty stew at the bottom of a French outhouse. After half a whiff of this ghoulish brine, I immediately stopped breathing through my nose but the taste was to remain in the back of my throat for months to come.The young agent had taken the brunt of the foul witch's brew, and at first I couldn't process what I was seeing. I thought somehow the young blond kid had been spirited away and replaced by a brown Golem, or a ATV rider that had spent the better part of a day driving through every mud puddle he could find after a torrential downpour. With some degree of compartmentalization I came to understand that for some unfathomable reason this kid hadn't moved - or hadn't been able to move - through the entire fecal deluge. He had weathered the entire assault head-on like some sort of hero from Greek Mythology. I had given this poor schmuck a one-man s*** bukkake that would make a Brazillian pornographer retch with disgust, and he was still in the same position he must have been from the moment of first impact. I tried to comprehend how he must be feeling, what he must be going through psychologically, but it became evident very quickly that he had become very broken. No doubt forced so deeply within himself once the firehose has been turned on that there was little to no hope of him ever coming back from it, certainly not without extensive psychotherapy or a lobotomy. I looked beyond his quivering, catatonic crouched form to see a perfect outline of him cutout on the white wall behind him, either side filled in with a dripping, opaque layer of alternately pulpy and runny fecal stew. I noticed two quivering masses at either extremes of the room and realized they were humanoid in form, although the caterwauling that was coming from these broken creatures was just blubbering gibberish. And this was the tableau that was burnt into my mind's eye for eternity.Needless to say, I missed my flight.In fact the next week is a blur. I have vague recollections of an army of Hazmat clad figures looming through the brown landscape of the soiled room, the slopping sounds of rubber boats squelching in puddles of fetid detritus, uncontrollable wailing and animal-like sounds issuing from the mouths of creatures that had been traumatized beyond their capacity for being put back together, the complete loss of sensation from my waist down as I was rolled through the room on a waterproof gurney, it's wheels struggling to surf on top of the s***-soaked floor. I spent a week or so in the hospital enclosed in a well ventilated, sealed room, with suited doctor coming in on the hour to monitor my vital signs as they tried to rehydrate my body. I had apparently expelled every available drop of water from my body that was possible to sustain life without for a short period of time. All of my clothes were incinerated in the hospital's crematorium, and the soiled bag of "Haribo Sugar Free Gummy Bears" was never recovered.This is my story. It is inconceivable to think that this kind of product can be sold legally and be misrepresented as 'food'. I was lucky, I survived. But as for the families of the survivors, and the survivors themselves, they will forever live with the trauma of the events that took place at Pearson International Airport on that snowy day in April 2013.</span></p><p><strong>File link:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZFIYJTPVUZ94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZFIYJTPVUZ94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</a> </p><p><strong>Sentiment result:</strong> 2 , <strong>Entities:</strong>  , <strong>Rating:</strong>1 , <strong>Sarcastic:</strong> false </p><br><hr><br>

<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:red"> Gummy bears good.  These are rather stiff and not-quite-chewy though, causing some jaw pain when you attempt to eat them.  And honestly, 5 pounds is too much.  I have about 4 pounds of them sitting in my pantry for the past month.</span></p><p><strong>File link:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQXK1DHVRLJ4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQXK1DHVRLJ4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</a> </p><p><strong>Sentiment result:</strong> 1 , <strong>Entities:</strong> [] , <strong>Rating:</strong>3 , <strong>Sarcastic:</strong> false </p><br><hr><br>

<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:black"> It was my last class of the semester, and the final exam was worth 30% of our grade.After a late night study session I felt confident, but I had to decide between sleeping in or cooking breakfast. My eyelids chose sleep.My stomach later regretted this decision, and after several uncomfortable stomach growls, I finally decided to make a quick stop by the campus bookstore and grab a snack before my test. Since the semester was ending and everyone was going home for the summer, a lot of items were on sale, including the snacks and candy that they kept up front. Being in the hungry state that I was in, it felt only logical to pick the largest, yet least expensive candy in order to get more bang for my buck.And there they sat: two bags of Haribo Sugar-Free Gummi Bears, buy one get one free."What a deal!" I thought naÃ¯vely. I would eat one bag before my test, and one bag afterwards.As I walked to class, I gleefully chewed on those abominable little bastards, unaware of the utter mayhem that they would soon unleash upon my poor, poor anus.I sat down at my desk as the professor informed us that, due to issues with cheating in the past, restroom breaks would be prohibited until the completion of the exam."I'll give you 10 minutes to use the restroom now; this will be your last chance. Any takers?"The demon bears hadn't released their unholy necromancy upon my stomach yet, so in my moment of ignorant foolishness, I remained seated, still munching on those miniature bear-shaped bombs.After the students wise enough to take the professor's offer had returned, the professor handed out the test. I was six questions in when it happened.It started subtly at first, almost like a slight tingly sensation in my lower abdomen. I thought nothing of it, assuming my intestines were just doing their thang. Little did I know that my intestines were trying desperately to warn me of the horror that was on the horizon.By question 9 it happened again, but this time it was followed by a sharp pain, as if those infernal hellions had orchestrated an attack upon my colon. I fought to contain the groan that tried escaping my lips. It was at this point I began to panic; something was going horribly long, and I needed to get through this test before it got any worse.By question 14 my worst fear was upon me; the Satan bears' burning, hot, liquidy dark magic crashed against my anal sphincter like a tidal wave. I was able to close the hatch just in time, but those relentless, toxic bears beat against it like Orcs breaking down the doors of Helm's Deep. I knew I wouldn't be able to so much as shift in my seat without risking a breach.I kept fighting through my exam, clenching my cheeks with all my might. Beads of sweat began rolling down my neck. Suddenly, a loud, gurgling war cry came from my belly, and the entire class lifted their heads.At this point, nothing mattered except expelling this ungodly presence from my bowels. With 15 questions left, I promptly wrote C for every answer and ran out of the classroom. My professor yelled something, but I was too preoccupied with the volcanic eruption that needed to take place before I could find sweet, sweet relief.I burst into the restroom like the Kool-Aid man and, behold, the handicap stall was empty. Sun rays from the adjacent window shone upon it, as if it were a gift from God himself. It took me less than .5 seconds to undo my belt buckle, pull down my pants, and finally relax my weary buttocks upon the toilet seat.It took absolutely no effort to expel this demon. Almost immediately, the floodgates of hell were opened and the damned, liquified souls of an entire bag's worth of gummi bears cried as they burned through my sphincter and into the watery abyss below. I had never felt such simultaneous relief and anguish in my life.After 30 more minutes of this, I immediately went home, dug a hole in my backyard, and burned the remaining bag of gummi bears.I leave with this; do not, I repeat do NOT eat these spawns of Satan. Not only did they cause me to fail my final test, but the anguish I experienced is something I wouldn't wish upon anyone, not even my worst enemy. The only place these god forsaken hell bears belong are buried deep below the Earth's surface.</span></p><p><strong>File link:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JGNJ5ZPJT4YC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JGNJ5ZPJT4YC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</a> </p><p><strong>Sentiment result:</strong> 2 , <strong>Entities:</strong>  , <strong>Rating:</strong>1 , <strong>Sarcastic:</strong> false </p><br><hr><br>

<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:black"> These gummi bears were recommended to me by my daughter-in-love.  I have to pass that recommendation along to others.

<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:black"> I didn't feel the need to plan my weekend around 5 small gummybears. But if you fail to plan, you plan to fail.It began with a noticeable change in the viscosity of my saliva. Within minutes of consumption, my mouth had filled with a thick foamy slime. Though I was in a cool climate controlled room a salty sweat broke out, and I felt my heartbeat quicken as my body threw itself into fight or flight.The animal noises broadcasting from my pelvis were an ominous warning of the violent acts that were to follow. I shouldered my way into the bathroom, clawing at my belt, moaning with pain. The smell came first. It started sweet, almost tangy. That was quickly overpowered by a cloying chemical perfume.The first volley of feces hit the water like soda cans and nickles. The resulting splash drenching my bottom in foul brackish water, but this was quickly becoming the least of my worries.After another moment, the noises in my core hit a fever pitch and I was struck rigid with pain. The sweat was now running into my eyes, but the room had turned ice cold and my hands began to spasm.I felt an insidious burning flooding my escape hatch. I gasped. Hot yellow poison began spraying from my rear, changing in pitch and echo as the stream of diarrhea whipped around the toilet bowl, creating a nightmarish Doppler effect that can only be appreciated in hindsight.My legs fell asleep sitting on the toilet. I couldn't have stood up if I wanted to.Wiping was a no-go. Toilet paper simply became a vile paper mache'. My hands were quickly soiled. A full blown shower was needed, and all of my towels had to be burned.So happy with my purchase, would recommend to friends and definitely buying again!</span></p><p><strong>File link:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3A6FMG2XKRQNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3A6FMG2XKRQNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</a> </p><p><strong>Sentiment result:</strong> 2 , <strong>Entities:</strong>  , <strong>Rating:</strong>5 , <strong>Sarcastic:</strong> false </p><br><hr><br>

<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:black"> Oh.my.god.  A five pound bag of Haribo gummi bears.  My wife thought I was having one of those big-box moments when I bought these, thinking we would never finish the bad in months.  I bought it for the kids, though, not me!  Right!  Right?  Right.  It has been a week, and the bag is already half empty.  The kids, well, they have had ten.  I had to sneak them to work to hide my cravings.  They are so, so little.  And cute.  And sweet, but not too sweet.  And they stand so nicely on my desk.  And have just enough resistance when you bite into them.  No where did I put that bag....-------------UPDATED--------------So in my zeal for these bears, I apparently ordered a few too many five pound bags, and found one I had stashed in the garage a few years back.  I opened them up, and they are still deeeelish.  A little hard, but now I have gummi-bear hard candy.  Now, with this added longevity, I put them up to six stars</span></p><p><strong>File link:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VH2SIAF3DBAH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VH2SIAF3DBAH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</a> </p><p><strong>Sentiment result:</strong> 2 , <strong>Entities:</strong>  , <strong>Rating:</strong>5 , <strong>Sarcastic:</strong> false </p><br><hr><br>

<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:black"> I have enjoyed Haribo gummi bears since I was six years old, so I might be a little biased when I say that they are easily the best gummi candies that I have ever tasted. I have not found any other gummi product which consistently tastes the same, holds well in storage for long periods of time under both high and cold temperatures, and can work well with almost any other food product as a dessert or snack. I purchased a bag of this product over a month ago, and am still slowly working my way through it - your mileage may vary, of course.As soon as I found out that they could be delivered I immediately purchased a bag. I will definitely be purchasing another package of these from Amazon when I begin to get low on my current supply. If you have never tried a bag of Haribo gummi bears, you should most definitely look for them in smaller bags in your local grocery stores.</span></p><p><strong>File link:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3Q3V0NWWEZJVB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3Q3V0NWWEZJVB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</a> </p><p><strong>Sentiment result:</strong> 2 , <strong>Entities:</strong>  , <strong>Rating:</strong>5 , <strong>Sarcastic:</strong> false </p><br><hr><br>

<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:black"> Oh my, how can anyone live without some gummi bears to chomp on?  I have been enjoying gummi bears for fifty years with the first being in Germany when I was a child. Through the years I have tucked some in a plastic bag while going to meetings, traveling, etc..  I have even been willing to share with people I like!  Haribo makes the best on the market today. Best flavor and texture by far.  I have a war with my self daily to not simply gobble up a handful of gummi bears as I pass through the kitchen.  Sometimes I resist and sometimes I don't.  I just keep my fingers crossed that Haribo will keep selling them just as they are now.</span></p><p><strong>File link:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R171RVNQ28G6RQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R171RVNQ28G6RQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</a> </p><p><strong>Sentiment result:</strong> 2 , <strong>Entities:</strong>  , <strong>Rating:</strong>5 , <strong>Sarcastic:</strong> false </p><br><hr><br>

<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:lightgreen"> I love Gummi Bears.... I buy them regularly whenever I enter a Walgreens or CVS. However, more often than not, they are stale.

<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:black"> Personally, when I'm eating snacks or am in constant need of a small bite, due to my high metabolism, I don't like to eat chips, Doritos, half- sandwiches, or cookies, but rather fruit snacks, jello/pudding, yogurt, fruit(s), chex mix/trail mix, or these Gummie Bears.  I haven't had Gummi Bears for awhile now, so I thought 'why not try a bulk size bag full' that can last about 3-5 weeks for me. I bought these and as soon as they arrived, a corner of the bag was opened and handful of gummi bears were consumed. I realized that this was a quality buy and it was going to happen again some time soon. The delivery was quick and I'm satisfied with the taste of them, which brings me back to my early 2000s when I was in grade school eating these & the last times I ate Haribo Gummi bears. From a general view, give them a try, especially if you have an Amazon Prime membership. You will be satisfied with them.</span></p><p><strong>File link:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5X3IGR682CFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5X3IGR682CFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</a> </p><p><strong>Sentiment result:</strong> 2 , <strong>Entities:</strong>  , <strong>Rating:</strong>5 , <strong>Sarcastic:</strong> false </p><br><hr><br>

<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:red"> You can't go wrong with these bears.  Same as the small bags.  About to reorder this, because they rock and 5 lbs lasts a good long while.  I suggest putting the remainder of the bears in a plastic container after opening or seal tightly with a clip.  But still best gummi bears around!</span></p><p><strong>File link:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ADVVDIDITLLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ADVVDIDITLLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</a> </p><p><strong>Sentiment result:</strong> 1 , <strong>Entities:</strong> [] , <strong>Rating:</strong>5 , <strong>Sarcastic:</strong> true </p><br><hr><br>

<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:darkgreen"> *These are not the atomic diarrhea bears* I have to put that out there first! Unless you are insanely sensitive to candy, these should not have that kind of affect on you. These gummi especially are tasty but rather hard in texture, I kind of knead them between my fingers to soften them up a bit, they are scrumptious that way! I had to physically make these hard for me to reach, so as to not over dose on them! Delicious.</span></p><p><strong>File link:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X01FR3HZGMMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X01FR3HZGMMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</a> </p><p><strong>Sentiment result:</strong> 4 , <strong>Entities:</strong> [] , <strong>Rating:</strong>5 , <strong>Sarcastic:</strong> false </p><br><hr><br>

<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:black"> I didn't feel the need to plan my weekend around 5 small gummybears. But if you fail to plan, you plan to fail.It began with a noticeable change in the viscosity of my saliva. Within minutes of consumption, my mouth had filled with a thick foamy slime.  Though I was in a cool climate controlled room a salty sweat broke out, and I felt my heartbeat quicken as my body threw itself into fight or flight.The animal noises broadcasting from my pelvis were an ominous warning of the violent acts that were to follow. I shouldered my way into the bathroom, clawing at my belt, moaning with pain. The smell came first. It started sweet, almost tangy. That was quickly overpowered by a cloying chemical perfume.The first volley of feces hit the water like soda cans and nickles. The resulting splash drenching my bottom in foul brackish water, but this was quickly becoming the least of my worries.After another moment, the noises in my core hit a fever pitch and I was struck rigid with pain. The sweat was now running into my eyes, but the room had turned ice cold and my hands began to spasm.I felt an insidious burning flooding my escape hatch. I gasped. Hot yellow poison began spraying from my rear, changing in pitch and echo as the stream of diarrhea whipped around the toilet bowl, creating a nightmarish Doppler effect that can only be appreciated in hindsight.My legs fell asleep sitting on the toilet. I couldn't have stood up if I wanted to.Wiping was a no-go. Toilet paper simply became a vile paper mache'. My hands were quickly soiled. A full blown shower was needed, and all of my towels had to be burned.So happy with my purchase, would recommend to friends and definitely buying again!</span></p><p><strong>File link:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DQNJRV27D3P0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DQNJRV27D3P0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</a> </p><p><strong>Sentiment result:</strong> 2 , <strong>Entities:</strong>  , <strong>Rating:</strong>5 , <strong>Sarcastic:</strong> false </p><br><hr><br>

<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:black"> Just like everyone else here it seems, I first experienced Haribo's magic in Germany.  I was at a train station and I needed a quick snack, so I bought a little bag of the Gold-Bears.  Ever since I ventured to find them in the States, but couldn't.  A few years ago, however, I noticed them popping up in their little bags, and had to buy one.While they're still the best gummy bears Stateside, I was a bit disappointed since they were harder than I had them in Deutschland.  But that's understandable, as I'm assuming they're imported from Germany, and gummy bears really can't retain their freshness for long when traveling across the sea, and then sitting on a store shelf waiting for someone to buy them.  They're not hard-hard like some of the other gummy bear brands you'll find here; they're just harder than in Europe.The flavors are strong and fantastic, and I have to stop from eating so many gummies at once for fear of my jaw getting sore--but they're so good!The 5lb bag is a great deal, but just be sure no one else is around.  I already had a bunch of co-workers coming up to get some, assuming they'll last forever since it's a large bag.  After ordering this about 2 weeks ago, I'm already having to consider reordering a second bag!</span></p><p><strong>File link:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VXY3WQWH9Z0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VXY3WQWH9Z0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</a> </p><p><strong>Sentiment result:</strong> 2 , <strong>Entities:</strong>  , <strong>Rating:</strong>4 , <strong>Sarcastic:</strong> false </p><br><hr><br>
<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:black"> Alright, so for the holiday season, I bought about 8 bags of these, 5 of which were given to my friends, and the remainder were to be for myself.When I first opened the box, I noticed there were a few gummies scattered around, and I could smell them too.  Apparently 1 of the bags had accidentally ripped open, perhaps during delivery.  It was a pretty small opening, about palm-size. I tasted the gummy bears in this bag and they were hard to chew on but still delicious.  I thought to check if any other bag had opened, and sure enough, there was one with a hole large enough to fit a couple fingers down.The flavor and texture of gummies in the unopened bags were great!  Due to having received 2 of 8 bags of hard gummies, my rating is 4, instead of 5.</span></p><p><strong>File link:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34KRDS3CE01FZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34KRDS3CE01FZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</a> </p><p><strong>Sentiment result:</strong> 2 , <strong>Entities:</strong>  , <strong>Rating:</strong>4 , <strong>Sarcastic:</strong> false </p><br><hr><br>

<p><strong>Review:</strong><span style="color:red"> My wife bought this for me when I was in Iraq.  She felt that all those little baggies would not be suitable.  These gummies tasted the same as the ones that come in smaller bags, except for the trip from the US to Iraq caused some to fuse together.  Instead of eating one gummy at a time, it was more like 3 gummies at a time.  You would not think that 5 lbs of gummy bears would be a lot, but it was so much I shared with my entire unit.</span></p><p><strong>File link:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NRKRFO56FRPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NRKRFO56FRPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</a> </p><p><strong>Sentiment result:</strong> 1 , <strong>Entities:</strong> [Iraq:LOCATION, US:LOCATION, Iraq:LOCATION] , <strong>Rating:</strong>4 , <strong>Sarcastic:</strong> false </p><br><hr><br>
